                                    Initially, before a new drug is introduced to human participants, it undergoes a stringent phase of testing on animals. This preliminary stage is crucial to ascertain a baseline safety and effectiveness profile of the drug. The process of clinical trials has been a cornerstone of medical advancements for over 50 years, adhering to stringent ethical and regulatory frameworks to ensure the safety and well-being of volunteers.

                                    Once a drug demonstrates promise in the pre-clinical stages, it transitions to clinical trials where human volunteers are involved. The journey commences with administering minimal doses of the drug to volunteers. This cautious approach is meticulously designed to gauge how the human body reacts to the new substance while minimizing any potential risks. Should the initial

                                    results prove favorable, demonstrating that the drug is well-tolerated, the protocol then advances to a phase where dosages are incrementally increased. This gradual escalation is instrumental in continuing to assess the drugâ€™s efficacy and in discerning the optimal dosage that balances maximum benefits with minimal side effects.
